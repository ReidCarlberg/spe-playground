**Important: although I am a Microsoft employee, this is not officially produced or maintained and you should only use it at your own risk.**

### Getting Started: 

- Enable SharePoint Embedded in your environment (shouldn't be required after GA)
- Use VS Code with SPE plug in to sign in to your tenant and create a container type ID
- Export your SPE configuration from from VS Code to your local machine.
- Clone this repo into your local environment
- Use ".env_template" to create your own ".env" file using values from the SPE configuration file
- Use NPM install to install all of your dependdencies
- Use NPM start to get the whole thing up and running

### Notes:

- There are sample docs in the aptly names "sample-docs" directory.
- ChatGPT wrote a fair amount of this, which was entertaining.
- This isn't designed to show best practices etc., just shows different aspects in action.
