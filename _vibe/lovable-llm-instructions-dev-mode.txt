Introducing Dev Mode
-------------------------------------------

Many users of this demo app are developers.  They want to see the detail of API calls.  

Create a way to track
a) API Calls, the full text
b) API Results, the full text

This should not be on the screen all the time, but should instead be an option the user can click in the header when they want to see it.
