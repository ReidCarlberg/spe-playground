8. SEARCH
-----------------------------------------------

-When you are done with this section, this search functionality should be visible in the header for every authenticated user.
-If the app currently has search functionality, remove it first, replace it with this.
-The app supports full-text and metadata search across SharePoint Embedded containers and files using Microsoft Graph's search API.
-Add a search icon to the header and display the search as a modal dialog when someone clicks it.
-Search results are generally an iteratable collection, but may also be a single non-iteratable item
